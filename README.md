**The primary concern of managing leave applications of the employees in an organization is hectic, with having
documentation of every employee's leave with its duration and a reason is not feasible.
Here our project is planned and designed to solve this issue by creating a web application.
The technology used is MEAN Stack, HTML CSS used for the front-end design including the back-end maintained
using NodeJs and AngularJs. NodeJs application is to build a connection between MongoDB (Database) and the front-
end. It also uses CRUD operations.
The final output of this web application would be to let employees request their leaves with admin authorised to get
the status of the employees requesting leaves.**
